/**
 * Concurrent File Writer
 *
 * This class allows PHP to write file content in paralle with very little locking. In fact locking is only
 * needed at the file creation and when the write is finalizing. This allows multiple PHP process or requests
 * to write the same file at the same time without locking each other.
 *
 * How does it work?
 *
 * Each time the write() is called a block file is created, which is a temporary file in the O.S. Then the finalize()
 * funciton is called all those blocks are merged into the file. Because each block is a separated file there is no
 * need for locking.
 *
 * Finalize() locks the file (meaning that only one finalize() can happen per file), because it is reposible for merging
 * all the blocks into the file.
